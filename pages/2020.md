  ## The 7th International Workshop on Model-driven Robot Software Engineering
---

# Call for Papers

Robots are an indispensable part of modern production facilities. In the future, robots will also become more common in daily life. Currently, however, there is a lack of standardization w. r. t. hardware/software platforms for robots, leading to a vast landscape of isolated, incompatible, task-specific and, thus, non-reusable solutions. Consequently, there is a need for new engineering methodologies for the design, implementation and execution of software for robotic platforms.

Model-Driven Robot Software Engineering (MORSE) is a promising research field combining Software Engineering and Robotics. Its objectives are to introduce model-driven development methodologies for the development of robot software. At the same time, formal methods should be transferred to robotics because "robot apps" must be certified and verified. MORSE attempts to fill this gap.

## Submission

The workshop participants will be selected based on their experience and ideas related to this maturing field. You are invited to apply for attendance by sending:

* a full paper (10 pages) on original research, lessons learned from realizing an approach or experiences on transferring a research prototype into practice,
* a position paper (6 pages) covering a well-argued vision or position,
* a demo paper (2 pages) describing a demonstration to be shown at the workshop, or
* an artifact paper (2 pages) together with the artifact, which is of use to the community (e.g., a reusable case study or a challenging example) 

All papers must conform to the IEEE formatting guidelines, which can be found at: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. Artifacts will be published in ReMoDD, the repository for model-driven development (http://www.remodd.org). At least three PC members will review each submission. The authors will be notified about acceptance before the MODELS 2019 early registration deadline.

You can submit your papers via EasyChair.

## Publication

All papers will be published as IEEE proceedings.
